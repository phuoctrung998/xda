                    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                        <h1>Why do we use it?</h1>
                        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted bthe readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The poinof using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normadistribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, contenhere', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishinpackages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their defaulmodel text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many wesites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over thyears, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humouand the like).

                        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random textIt has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BCmaking it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professoat Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the morobscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, angoing through the cites of the word in classical literaturediscovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremeof Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during thRenaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor siamet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
